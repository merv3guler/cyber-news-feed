An automated, serverless Threat Intelligence Aggregator that collects, analyzes, and summarizes the latest cybersecurity news using Artificial Intelligence.

## 🚀 How It Works

This project leverages **GitHub Actions** to run a fully automated pipeline every day. No servers, no databases, just pure code.

1.  **Collection:** A Python script scrapes RSS feeds from trusted sources like *The Hacker News*, *BleepingComputer*, and *CISA*.
2.  **Analysis:** Each article is analyzed by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash AI** to determine if it's a "Zero-Day" threat.
3.  **Summarization:** The AI generates a technical, one-paragraph summary in English.
4.  **Archiving:** New articles are merged with the historical data (`articles.json`) to keep a persistent record.
5.  **Deployment:** The results are rendered into a Cyberpunk-themed HTML dashboard and deployed to **GitHub Pages**.

## ✨ Features

* **🕵️‍♂️ Zero-Day Detection:** Automatically flags critical vulnerabilities and exploits.
* **🧠 AI Summaries:** Summaries are generated by AI, not just truncated text.
* **📂 Historical Data:** Keeps track of past news, not just the last 24 hours.
* **🌗 Dark/Light Mode:** Cyberpunk green for the night, clean white for the day.
* **📊 Excel Export:** Download the intelligence report as a CSV file.
* **📱 Social Sharing:** Share directly to WhatsApp, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), or Email.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** Python
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
* **Automation:** GitHub Actions
* **Frontend:** Jinja2 (HTML/CSS/JS)
* **Data:** JSON (Flat file storage)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and informational purposes only. The summaries are generated by an AI model and should be verified with the original source.
